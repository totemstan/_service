> [Natural logarithm][math-ln] of the [square root][math-sqrt] of [2π][const-pi].


## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install const-ln-sqrt-two-pi
```


## Usage

``` javascript
var LN_SQRT_TWO_PI = require( 'const-ln-sqrt-two-pi' );
```

#### LN_SQRT_TWO_PI

[Natural logarithm][math-ln] of the [square root][math-sqrt] of [2π][const-pi].

``` javascript
LN_SQRT_TWO_PI === 0.9189385332046728;
```


## Examples

``` javascript
var LN_SQRT_TWO_PI = require( 'const-ln-sqrt-two-pi' );

console.log( LN_SQRT_TWO_PI );
// returns 0.9189385332046728
```

To run the example code from the top-level application directory,

``` bash
$ node ./examples/index.js
```

## Tests

### Unit

This repository uses [tape][tape] for unit tests. To run the tests, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ make test
```

All new feature development should have corresponding unit tests to validate correct functionality.


### Test Coverage

This repository uses [Istanbul][istanbul] as its code coverage tool. To generate a test coverage report, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ make test-cov
```

Istanbul creates a `./reports/coverage` directory. To access an HTML version of the report,

``` bash
$ make view-cov
```


### Browser Support

This repository uses [Testling][testling] for browser testing. To run the tests in a (headless) local web browser, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ make test-browsers
```

To view the tests in a local web browser,

``` bash
$ make view-browser-tests
```
